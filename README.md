# Student-Attendance-Record-System
The goal of this project is to develop a Student Attendance Record system that allows teachers to manage and track student attendance efficiently. The system uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for structure and organization, and integrates an email notification service to alert students attendance-related updates.
